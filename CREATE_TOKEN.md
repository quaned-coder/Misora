# How to Create GitHub Personal Access Token

## Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
   - Make sure you're signed in

2. **Click your profile picture** (top right) → **Settings**

3. **Scroll down** in the left sidebar → Click **"Developer settings"**
   - It's at the very bottom of the settings menu

4. **Click "Personal access tokens"** → **"Tokens (classic)"**

5. **Click "Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**

6. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Note**: `Misora Development` (or any name you want)
   - **Expiration**: Choose 90 days, or "No expiration" (your choice)
   - **Scopes**: Check ✅ **`repo`** (this gives full repository access)
     - This will automatically check all repo sub-options

7. **Scroll down and click "Generate token"**

8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately!
   - It will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - You won't be able to see it again after you leave this page
   - Save it somewhere safe (you'll use it as your password)

9. **Use this token** when Git asks for your password
